## Security Notice

This directory contains sensitive implementation details and should never be published or exposed publicly. The .gitignore file is configured to exclude this directory from version control.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. All AI decision-making logic should be in the brain/ directory
2. Channel-specific implementations go in their respective directories
3. Core SDK functionality stays in core/
4. All files should have comprehensive error handling
5. Use TypeScript strict mode
6. Include detailed logging
7. Implement rate limiting
8. Add security checks

## Development

To work on the internal implementation:

1. Create a new branch
2. Implement the feature
3. Add tests (in the test directory)
4. Submit for review

Remember: These files contain the intellectual property of Sadellari DAO and should be treated as confidential.
